Whether they had played with dolls or not their bodies physically and emotionally and instinctively are preparing for motherhood with the onset of periods the hormone levels increase and the brain and body responds. That is all a very natural experience. Females make choices through life and defer and mentally push aside those natural body rhythms if they aspire to do and achieve other things outside of motherhood. Men, if they are good at childcare, they have also mentally pushed aside their natural body rhythms to aspire to be a good father to their children and they can be as good but they have had to mentally and physically worked a lot harder to achieve the same outcome as a natural mother. Men can be as good at childcare as women, but women can be as good as men at other things. Accept that we are all human beings and when needs must humans can only survive by adapting to the situations we are all faced with at any given time. If we actually enjoy the adaptation it is even better.",

We are all entitled to our opinion - too many 'celebritieswant to make their opinions into a set of rules for everyone else.
