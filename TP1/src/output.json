What's he supposed to say."We women are as equal at business as men (true) so lets hand pregnancy overto men (impossible); and we'll stand at urinals too so there?" Doubtless,one day, someone will invent plug in men's genitalia for women so they cando that. We are two different genders. We have different hormones. What Ihave found is that women want to be treated the same as men until it suitsthem to be treated as women. If I stride through a supermarket entrance anda woman coming from a different direction is heading my way, I'm alwaysexpected to give way. Should I????"

True, I sincerely believe thatchildren should be brought up by members of their own family and not befarmed out to nurseries etc, and I do not accept that two mums/two dads isright either, but to say that men are no good at caring for kids is like theold idea that women should only aspire to be nurses and leavepropermedical issuesto the men! We are all entitled to our opinion - too many'celebritieswant to make their opinions into a set of rules for everyoneelse. Personally I find many women uncaring, callous and downrightobjectionable and wouldn't trust them to look after a stick insect, butthat's because I lived in a matriarchal household - it was hell!"
