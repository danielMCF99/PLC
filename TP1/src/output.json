However, NATUREdecrees that men don't get pregnant, don't give birth, don't breast feed andgenerally, by-and-large, a crying baby wants mum more than dad. If that'sstereotyping, then blame whatever god you subscribe to or publish a rebuffto Darwin's theory."

What Ihave found is that women want to be treated the same as men until it suitsthem to be treated as women.

True, I sincerely believe thatchildren should be brought up by members of their own family and not befarmed out to nurseries etc, and I do not accept that two mums/two dads isright either, but to say that men are no good at caring for kids is like theold idea that women should only aspire to be nurses and leavepropermedical issuesto the men! We are all entitled to our opinion - too many'celebritieswant to make their opinions into a set of rules for everyoneelse. Personally I find many women uncaring, callous and downrightobjectionable and wouldn't trust them to look after a stick insect, butthat's because I lived in a matriarchal household - it was hell!"
