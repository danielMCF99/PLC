             "comment" : "Women's bodies and brains areordinarily preparing for motherhood from a very young age. Whetherthey had played with dolls or not their bodies physically andemotionally and instinctively are preparing for motherhood with theonset of periods the hormone levels increase and the brain and bodyresponds. That is all a very natural experience. Females makechoices through life and defer and mentally push aside those naturalbody rhythms if they aspire to do and achieve other things outsideof motherhood.Men, if they are good at childcare, they have also mentally pushedaside their natural body rhythms to aspire to be a good father totheir children and they can be as good but they have had to mentallyand physically worked a lot harder to achieve the same outcome as anatural mother.Men can be as good at childcare as women, but women can be as goodas men at other things.Accept that we are all human beings and when needs must humans canonly survive by adapting to the situations we are all faced with atany given time. If we actually enjoy the adaptation it is evenbetter."

Why would womenhave a problem with so logical a comment as that. Women are better atlooking after their babies. Its in their genes. What's he supposed to say."We women are as equal at business as men (true) so lets hand pregnancy overto men (impossible); and we'll stand at urinals too so there?" Doubtless,one day, someone will invent plug in men's genitalia for women so they cando that. We are two different genders. We have different hormones. What Ihave found is that women want to be treated the same as men until it suitsthem to be treated as women. If I stride through a supermarket entrance anda woman coming from a different direction is heading my way, I'm alwaysexpected to give way. Should I????"

     "comment" : "Itoo agree that women are better at looking after babies until they are readyfor school.I cannot understand people planning to have a family then handing the babyover to a professional to look after.I also think that most troubled toddlers are suffering from lack of bondingwith the Mother, after all she had the baby and should be responsible forits well being."

This deeply miss-guided doctrine of"we're all the same" will fail, because we are not all the same. The factthat through economic pressure fathers look after children doesnt mean itis the best or natural way."

     "comment" : "Whata load of unmitigated drivel. Just because women carry and deliver babiesdoes not make them better at child rearing. True, I sincerely believe thatchildren should be brought up by members of their own family and not befarmed out to nurseries etc, and I do not accept that two mums/two dads isright either, but to say that men are no good at caring for kids is like theold idea that women should only aspire to be nurses and leavepropermedical issuesto the men! We are all entitled to our opinion - too many'celebritieswant to make their opinions into a set of rules for everyoneelse. Personally I find many women uncaring, callous and downrightobjectionable and wouldn't trust them to look after a stick insect, butthat's because I lived in a matriarchal household - it was hell!"
